            <h3>introduction</h3>

            <p>
                This project was motivated by wondering about emotional contagion, and how acts of love, or
                even simple kindness might cascade to create more love and kindness. It is in the spirit
                "Random Acts of Kindness" or "pay it forward", where generous acts are performed without
                an expection of returns, but hoping the acts are paid forward through kind acts to others.
                Besides kind acts cascading so can unkind acts.
            </p>
            <p>
                This simulation models each person as being sad, happy, or emotionally neutral. Initially all
                people are in the neutral state. There is a parameter, emotionalDrift, which models how emotions
                may change over time, based of reaction to events happening to a person.
                There is a rate pAction at which people take actions to neighbors,
                and probababilities pNiceGivenSad, and pNiceGivenHappy of kind actions (e.g. smile) given that a
                person feels sad or happy, and probabilities pMeanGivenSad, pMeanGivenHappy, of mean actions
                (e.g. acting rudely) give that a person feels sad or happy. During the simulation, little dots will
                move between people indicating interactions.
            </p>
            <p>
                The simulation can be paused, or various parameters changed through the control dialog.
                Selecting "mobile" causes the people to move around some. This can be used to produce more
                randome clusters, by letting them move for a few seconds. The distThreshold controls how close
                people have to be to interact.
                The right mouse button can be used to pan, and the trackwheel can be used to zoom in or out.
                Clicking on a person with the left mouse button, causes them to be happy. Try this, and see how it can
                cascade so that the kindness spreads.
            </p>
            <h3>Love Bomb</h3>
            <p>
                This simulation was first imaged as a sort of art piece, presenting the idea of a "Love Bomb".
                Just as in some circumstances, a chain reaction of Uranium atoms could cause horrible destructon
                one might wonder, could a corresponding chain reaction occur in some positive sense. One way
                it could is through a contagion of positive emotion. Start this simulation by clicking
            </p>
            <p>
                <button id="setup1" onclick="setupLoveBomb()">Setup Love Bomb</button>
            </p>
            <p>
                Now the population is all in the neutral state. Left click on any of the people, which is a kind
                act to make them happy! They will "pay it forward" by randomly acting kind to their neighbors.
                The good feeling will propagate until all the people are happy.

                You can play around with the paramters to explore the resiliance of the community as a functiono
                of the general emotional volatility (emotionalDrift) as well as the interaction between positive
                and negative acts.

                Notice that in a community, norms of kind behaviours to others creates a short of emotional
                resiliance that helps recover from emotional volatility.
