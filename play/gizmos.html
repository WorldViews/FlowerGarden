  <h3>Controls</h3>
  <li>
    Click on the center or circumferance of a crankshaft to select it.  Dragging
    will then move or resize it.
  </li>
  <li>
    Clicking on a sliprod collar point will select the sliprod.  The collar point
    can be moved by dragging.   Clicking on the end of a sliprod to resize.  This
    is easier when the model is paused.
  </li>
  <li>
    Clicking away from any widgets will clear the selection.
  </li>
  <li>
    When a widget is selected, shift-clicking someonere will add a new sliprod with
    a collar at the specified point.   If no widget is selected, shift-clicking anywhere
    will add a crankshaft at that point.
  </li>
  <li>
    A mousewheel can be used to zoom in and out, and the right mouse can be used to pan
    the view.
  </li>
  <!--
  <li>
    clicking the download button will save out a JSON file describing the current configuration.
    A JSON file can be dragged onto the canvas to set the model to that configuration.

  <h3>Background</h3>
  This page is a simple study in some mechanisms of a crankshaft and sliprods.  It was motivated
  by seeing an toy on display at 
  <a href="https://shop.reachandteach.com/">Reach & Teach</a>
   that Derrick Kikuchi had constructed from origami
  and k-nex widgets.   A dolphin was on the end of a rod following a graceful path that was evocative
  of a dolphin jumping out of water.   The path was roughly curved, as it would be if it were following
  a circular arc, but looked more natural. It was similar to the movement of the pigs shown in
  <a href="https://www.instructables.com/Knex-Origami-Automata/">here</a>.
     I suppose the path in such a case is better approximated by
  a parabala, and by using the sliprod mechanism, a pleasing path was produced.   That got me interested
  in what paths could be produced by this kind of mechansim.  Also, one end of the sliprod is driven
  by a crankshaft, and is following exacly a circular path.  What path is traced by the other end?
  Is it also a circle?

    This tool is in now way a general physics engine or simulator.  But if you find this interesting
    you should check out the delightful 2D engine called <a href="http://www.algodoo.com/">algodoo</a>
    Also, note that the question of what trajectories could be produced by a suitable mechanism is similar
    to how fourier series could approximate curves.  A good explorable explanation is
